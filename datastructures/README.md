# Datastructures

Organize the data in the memory of a computer in such a way that the following operations can be performed efficiently (S is the current set of objects):

- Search(S,k): A pointer x to an object with key k=key[x] is returned or NIL if there is no object with key k in S
- Insert(S,x): Object x is inserted in S
- Delete(S,x): Object x is removed from S
