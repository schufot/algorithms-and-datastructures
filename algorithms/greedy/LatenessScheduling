# LatenessScheduling

- Input: Number of tasks n, fields t: t[i] contains the duration of the i-th task, field d: d[i] contains deadline of the i-th task; tasks are sorted by ascending deadline
- Ouput: Start times of the tasks so that the maximum delay is minimized
- Pseudocode:

```
  LatenessScheduling(t,d,n)
  A = new array [1..n]
  z = 0
  for i=1 to n do
    A[i] = z
    z = z + t[i]
  return A
```

- Time complexity: O(n)
