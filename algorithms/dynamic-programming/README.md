# Dynamic programming algorithms

## Dynamic programming approach

- Describe optimal solution of a given instance by optimal solutions of solutions of “smaller” instances
- Describe recursion termination
- Solve the recursion “bottom-up” by filling in a table step by step of the required partial solutions
