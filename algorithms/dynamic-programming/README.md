# Dynamic programming algorithms

## Dynamic programming approach

- Describe optimal solution of a given instance by optimal solutions of solutions of “smaller” instances
- Describe recursion termination
- Solve the recursion “bottom-up” by filling in a table step by step of the required partial solutions

## Development of recursion equation
- Input consists of n elements
- Idea: Order the elements from 1 to n
- Express optimal solution for the first i elements as a function of the optimal solution of the first i-1 elements
